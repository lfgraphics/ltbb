    question: "What is estate planning?",
    answer:
      "Estate planning is the preparation of activities to manage a person's asset base in the case of incapacity or death. The planning covers the distribution of assets to heirs as well as the payment of estate taxes. Most estate plans are created with the assistance of an estate law practitioner.\n\nHouses, automobiles, stocks, artwork, life insurance, pensions, and debt are examples of assets that might be included in an individual's estate. Individuals plan their estates for a variety of purposes, including maintaining family wealth, caring for a surviving spouse and children, supporting children's or grandchildren's education, or leaving a philanthropic legacy.",
