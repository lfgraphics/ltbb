        question: "What is legal research?",
        answer: "The practice of seeking material to support your present case is known as legal research. This information might include existing laws that are important to the case or past instances that are comparable to the present case being worked on. It is usually done by the lawyer who took the case; however, it might be outsourced to someone who knows the law."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the purpose of legal research?",
        answer: 'Legal research is critical since it may "make or break" your case. It provides the attorneys with the knowledge they require to win their case.\n\n They can research current laws that are pertinent to the case so that they know how to exploit this legislation to their advantage. They can also research prior situations that are similar to the present ones, so they know what to do and what not to do.'

    {
        question: "What are some helpful hints for enhancing your legal research?",

It also allows you to spend more time determining which sources are relevant and which are not, boosting the quality of your legal research.\n\nHowever, devoting too much time to legal study will be inconvenient. Outsourcing is the ideal option; it is a simple and quick approach to obtain high-quality legal research services."
